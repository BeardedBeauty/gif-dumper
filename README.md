# gif-dumper
This project was built simply to find gifs using the giphy API. Basic Javascript and jQuery are used.

## How to Use

### Search
All that is required is to type in something into the form, and when 'add' is pressed, a new button appears with the text from the form. When clicked, the body populates with giphy results from the text.

### Viewing
Gifs by default are static images, clicking on one will play the gif. Clicking again will pause.
